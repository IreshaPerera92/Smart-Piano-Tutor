# Smart-Piano-Tutor
As the name implies the whole purpose of this system is to provide guidance to play the piano, so that anybody can play the piano regardless of whether the player is a piano expert or not. When we provide the music sheet to the system, the system scans the sheet and convert it in to a program code. There are set of LEDs in front of each key and these LEDs are driven by the Raspberry Pi. According to the program cord the LEDâ€™s blink to indicate which key needs to be pressed. The player can follow the LEDs. Then the music perceive, as the piano is played by a pianist.
